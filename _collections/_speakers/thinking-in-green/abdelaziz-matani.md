also has an established working experience in Higher Education Quality
Assurance. This year Dr Matani published his first invention's patent in the
USA and KSA and has other inventions filed, these of which are well in their
way to being published, built and marketed internationally.

He will talk about his most recent invention, a ground breaking device designed
to turn sea water into drinkable water almost immediately. This device is fully
green, leaves no waste and uses no energy. It simply uses reverse osmosis and
wave pressure to turn non drinkable water into drinkable water on the spot.
