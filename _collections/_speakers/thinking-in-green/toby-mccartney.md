Toby is the CEO and founder of MacRebur Limited, a company which uses plastic
waste to fix and enhance the quality of roads.

His story began in Southern India with a charity helping people who work on
landfill sites as 'pickers'. He noticed how some of the waste plastics
retrieved by the pickers were put into potholes, petrol poured all over them,
and the rubbish set alight until the plastics melted into the craters to form a
makeshift pothole filler. Toby thought that UK councils might 'frown upon
this', but he did not let this stop him. Together with two friends, Nick and
Gordon, he formed MacReburÂ® and came up with an innovative idea to take a mix
of waste plastics, pelletise them and add them into the making of an enhanced
asphalt road. After 18 months of testing and trials, they had 'MR6' - a
patent-pending, green alternative to standard asphalt which actually increases
the lifespan of a road.
