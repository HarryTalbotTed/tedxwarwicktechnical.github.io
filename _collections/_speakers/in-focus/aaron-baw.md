8 seconds.

On average, thatâ€™s how long it'll take before our minds are drawn to the next
exciting thing.

We live for the 'ding', the chime - the buzz in our pockets. Our brains are
becoming conditioned to crave it. As the world rushes toward increasing levels
of connectedness, the art of retreating, of taking a step back, to work with
intent, is being lost.

Amidst a sea of superficiality and distraction, third year computer science
student Aaron aims to present a case for the true value of focus. To help us
learn faster, work better, and help us to conquer mountains - to live with
greater meaning and intent, and achieve things we never thought possible.
