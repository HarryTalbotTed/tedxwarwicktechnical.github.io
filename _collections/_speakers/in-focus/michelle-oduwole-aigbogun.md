Michelle is a postgraduate Programme & Project Management student, at the
University of Warwick. She has industry level of experience of working with
people, running and managing events. She has worked with prominent companies
such as Universal Music Group â€“ Nigeria, MTV Base Africa and Reprezent Radio.
Being British and of Nigerian descent, she wants to change the perception of
how people see Africa. Therefore, her TED talk is about the rise and acceptance
of the African culture and sound, mainly focusing on Afrobeats. She plans on
doing this by further exposing these sounds and contributing to the 'Africa To
The World' movement. Michelle plans to be one of the future pillars of Africa's
creative industry, and it is probably fair to say she is well on her way.
