short-bio: "Philosophy, Politics & Economics Student"
---

Andrea Arnal is a passionate and energetic second year Philosophy, Politics,
and Economics (PPE) student at the University of Warwick.

Her parents are from Venezuela, but she has never lived there. She holds three
different citizenships and residencies; nonetheless she considers herself
Venezuelan.

Andrea will discuss how the current social, political and economic crisis in
her country is affecting both friends and family on a personal level. People
are fleeing by the millions, to leave behind a country plagued by hunger,
corruption, economic insecurity and crime. Many refer to this as a diaspora -
when a country's citizens are forced to leave their home country.

Her aim is to inspire you to not be afraid to leave everything behind in order
to move forward.
