Danielle will be talking about The Big Black Blood Issue: Sickle Cell Anaemia,
the world's foremost and at times most lethal genetic disease.

She will be sharing her experience of this disease, her aim to start a new
dialogue around the topic and the need for reform in how it is perceived and
treated.

Critically she wants to bring about an awareness of the importance of blood and
organ donation.
