Nick is the Chadwick Professor of Civil Engineering at UCL. He invented, and
runs, the UCL Pedestrian Accessibility and Movement Environment Laboratory,
which is a life-scale environmental space, to conduct his research into the
environment's interactions with people. He is working extensively with bodies
such as Transport for London, national and local governments, and civil society
in the UK, EU, Latin America, Japan and China to help create an adaptive and
sustainable urban realm which is responsive to people and their needs. He aims
to create cities in which all people can feel comfortable and lead healthy
lives.
