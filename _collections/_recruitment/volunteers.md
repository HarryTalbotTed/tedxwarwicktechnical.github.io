      The Marketing team works towards moulding the public perception and the
      branding of TEDxWarwick, in and around the Warwick community, through the
      promotion of our event as well as the TED ethos. The framework and focus
      of our outreach effort binds us closely with the rest of the team, in
      particular Creative and Technical. The Marketing team are looking for
      members who:

      - Preferably have previous experience in marketing.
      - Can creatively and effectively communicate core ideas (both verbally
        and in writing)
      - Understand the audience they are trying to reach
      - And ideally (but not necessarily) have some experience working with
        social media and blogging

      Most importantly, however, the Marketing team values a genuine drive to
      overcome uncertainties and instinctive passion for learning, as well as
      organisation skills and an ability to work under pressure.

      The Operations team is responsible for the flawless execution of
      TEDxWarwick 2019. This includes -- and is not limited to -- organising
      the venue, catering, ticketing and volunteer management. You will be
      working closely with the other TEDxWarwick teams to ensure that all
      logistics and operations are in order. An Operations team member must be
      able to communicate effectively with service providers, have a great
      attention to detail and be able to deal with unexpected problems. Due to
      the nature of the work, team members must be able to dedicate large
      amounts of time in the weeks leading up to the event. We are looking for
      team members who:

      - Have strong organisational skills, preferably with previous experience
        in organising events
      - Have excellent attention to detail
      - Have strong communication skills
      - Are flexible, passionate, conscientious, and are willing to take the
        initiative

## Volunteer at TEDxWarwick 2019

#### We want to make TEDxWarwick 2019 our best conference yet!

The scale of initiatives we are running this year mean that we will need your
support in the coming weeks leading up to our flagship conference for 2019,
Architects of Tomorrow. We are looking for passionate students to help us with
marketing, registration, stewarding and photography.

If you love TED and the spirit of *Ideas Worth Spreading*, and want to engage
with one of the biggest and (in our opinion) best TEDx events in the UK
(boasting an audience of 1200 and an online viewership of over 2.8 million),
please fill out an application and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.
