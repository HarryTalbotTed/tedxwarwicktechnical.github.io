*Following on from the success of last year's Student Salon, we have decided to
bring it back again!*

We all have moments when we lose track of our identity. We forget about our
goals, disconnect from our roots, send our priorities into disarray;
experiences tumble out of our hands and out of control, and we learn nothing
from them.

This salon zooms in on personal stories and their interaction with these
external experiences. Our speakers' stories are those of resilience, purpose,
and connection, ones that highlight the simultaneous universality and
singularity of the lessons life teaches us. We have control over our
experiences, and we can hold our identity back in focus.
