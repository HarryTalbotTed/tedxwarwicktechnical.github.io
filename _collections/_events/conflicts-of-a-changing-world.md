  We all live in awareness of the conflicts. They shape the world around us,

  identity of conflict is dominated by a collection of contentious issues: war,

  but none capture its essence.

### We all live in awareness of the conflicts.

They shape the world around us, but how often do we question what the word
means for the 21<sup>st</sup> century? The identity of conflict is dominated by
a collection of contentious issues: war, religion, terror. Each of these words
contains shades of what 'conflict' is, but none capture its essence.

For our second Salon of the year, TEDxWarwick is inviting four leading
university lecturers to deliver talks inspired by their own research expertise.
We aim to look at the implications of conflict when viewed through different
disciplines, evaluate the challenges it presents, and contextualise what
exactly it means for us to confront the Conflicts of a Changing World.
