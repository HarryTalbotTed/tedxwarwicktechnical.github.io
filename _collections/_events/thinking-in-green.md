The United Nations tells us we have 12 years left until climate change becomes
irreversible. Headlines like this flood in: of deniers and outspoken
supporters, rays of hope and bleak forecasts, of commitments held and broken.
Climate change awareness is gaining traction as researchers and activists fight
for recognition of the urgent need for concerted global action, but the
progress made towards policy agreement is eclipsed by news of the UN
accelerated time-limit and environmental promises abandoned by the US, Brazil,
and others.

TEDxWarwick, for our second event of the year, calls together different sectors
and brings them under the lens of environment, to go further than just
recognition of the immense problem facing us - to look for innovation,
solutions, and hope - can technology help limit environmental damage? How can
we re-use waste to economize production processes and reverse current trends?
We invite our speakers, and audience, not only to believe the assertions about
the urgency of major change, but to work our way towards practical, creative
responses, and to think: of problems, of answers, and of the future - in green.
